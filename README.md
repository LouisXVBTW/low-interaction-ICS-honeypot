# Stage 1

This wille be for general notes are i recode this for when im taking screenshots and writing it up

#### What is stage 1?

Stage 1 is creating the main file structure, designing the basic protocols and loading all of them from the protocols folder. This will have to include unit testing somehow.

 - [ ] ==Basic file structure==
 - [ ] ==Design basic protocol==
 - [ ] ==Generate multiple protocols==
 - [ ] ==Make everything run in parrallel==
 - [ ] ==Unit tests==

 so um apparently unit testing sockets is no fun :)
