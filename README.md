#### What is stage 1?

Stage 1 is creating the main file structure, designing the basic protocols and loading all of them from the protocols folder. This will have to include unit testing somehow.

 - [x] ==Basic file structure==
 - [x] ==Design basic protocol==
 - [x] ==Generate multiple protocols==
 - [x] ==Make everything run in parrallel==
 - [x] ==Unit tests==

 so um apparently unit testing sockets is no fun :)
